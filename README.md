This program is written and implemented using Java in Android Studio. Firebase products like cloud firestore, authentication and cloud storage is used as a means to handle the application login and logout, signing up account, as well as storing the application data. 
The general idea behind this application is to allow employers to list jobs and to allow employees to view and apply the jobs listed. In-app messaging feature is available to allow employers and employees to communicate with each other. As of now, the application allows employers and employees to sign in and sign up, post and view job listing and privately chat with each other.
